🏦 Bank System – Python (Built From Scratch)

This is a small banking simulation project I created to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. I wrote the classes, methods, and flow on my own, and used AI tools occasionally for debugging or suggestions — but every part of the logic is understood and implemented by me.

The project lets a user:

Create an account

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check their balance

Exit cleanly

It’s a simple console-based project, but it helped me understand how real systems store and update data step-by-step.

💡 What I Learned

How to design and use classes in Python

How to store and update a user’s balance

How to build functions that work together

How to handle invalid input

How to build a real system flow

🧠 How the System Works

A BankAccount class stores balance and methods (deposit, withdraw, etc.)

The main loop asks the user what they want to do

Inputs get validated

The account updates immediately

User can exit anytime

▶️ Run the Program
python bank.py

🚀 Future Improvements

Save account data to a file

Support multiple accounts

Add a GUI version with Tkinter

Connect to a database
